# Self-Hosted Bold Checkout on Adobe Commerce

If you need full customization, or full control over how your checkout looks and behaves, you may want to self-host your Bold Checkout implementation.

Self-hosted checkout is based on the prebuilt [Open Source Checkout Templates](https://github.com/bold-commerce/checkout-experience-templates). Once you set up the templates, you can customize your checkout experience from there.

## Installation

[Refer to the developer documentation](https://developer.boldcommerce.com/guides/platform-integration/adobe-commerce/self-hosted-checkout) for instructions on installing and setting up self-hosted Bold Checkout on your Adobe Commerce store.
